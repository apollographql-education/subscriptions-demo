# Subscriptions Demo Code: HTTP Callback Protocol with Apollo Router

Hello and welcome! This repository houses the demo code used for the Apollo blog post "Federated Subscriptions with Routerâ€™s HTTP Callback Protocol."

To follow along, you'll need the following:
- Node installed on your computer (we recommend using [the latest version](https://nodejs.org/en/download)) as well as an IDE (we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- A GraphOS account on the Enterprise plan.[Click here to sign up for a free Enterprise trial](https://studio.apollographql.com/signup?type=enterprise-trial&referrer=odyssey-ent)


## Set up the graph

To get your graph set up on GraphOS, follow these steps.

1. Create a new graph under an organization on the GraphOS Enterprise plan.
2. Note down your environment variables (`APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and `APOLLO_KEY`). You'll use these to authenticate to your graph.
1. Publish the subgraph schemas for each 
The [subgraph schemas](demo code link) are published to the graph, with the `name`, `schema`, and `routing_url` reported for each.
The graph ref and graph API key provided by GraphOS are used to boot up a local router connected to the graph.
Both subgraph servers are running locally.
